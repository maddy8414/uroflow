DIY uroflow machine

Make your own uroflow machine!!!

I made 2 youtube videos:
1. We will see what uroflow machine is (part of urodynamic study), how to make the machine and also see how to use it.
2. We will see how to calibrate the machine and what does my firmware offer.

Free for personal use. Commercial use is negotiable. Simple to use, high precision, low cost (ca.10â‚¬).
